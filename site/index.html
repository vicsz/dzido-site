            <h1>Dzido</h1>
            <p>Meet Dzido (aka Zdzislaw Szoltysek), a philosopher by day and an aspiring comedian by night. His skiing skills are as refined as his punchlines, which is to say, they both need work. When Dzido isn't pondering life's mysteries or wiping out on the slopes, he's hosting his podcast "I Think, Therefore I Google" - a lighthearted exploration of life, laughter, and existential musings. Remember: if you can't find Dzido on the stage or on the mountain, he's probably just taking a break to laugh at himself.</p>
